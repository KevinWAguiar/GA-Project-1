For Project 1, datasets were gathered for two major Standardized Tests administered in the United State, the ACT and the SAT.  Data for years 2017 and 2018 were gathered for both tests.  The intention was to try and find insights with regards to how the College Board, the organization that administers the SAT, can increase its sales.

After formatting, and organizing the datasets, the data was then plotted on different charts to allow for visualization.   Through the charts, insights were provided.   When the correlation between the ACT Participation Rate and the SAT Participation Rate was plotted, the strong, negative correlation was apparent.  This was important, because it indicated that the states with high participation in one test, had low participation in the other (usually).

Investing in a state with high ACT Participation Rates may be wasteful, since the test is clearly well established within that state; this would make it increasingly difficult for the SAT to gain participation.  At the same time, investing in a state that has a high SAT Participation Rate would be wasteful as well, since, by definition, it would not have much opportunity for growth.

This created a peculiar situation, since the College Board would have to find a state where the participation rates in both the SAT and ACT tests were low, which, again, was unlikely, shown by the strong, negative correlation between participation rates.

Eventually, Oregon was decided on as the state to invest in.  Its mean and median participation rates in the ACT were lower than the national statistics in ACT Participation Rate.  Oregonâ€™s mean and median participation rates in the SAT were higher than the national statistics in SAT Participation Rate, though only slightly.  Furthermore, Oregon currently does not require any testing, creating an opportunity for the College Board to lobby its state officials in making it the official Standardized Test of the State.
